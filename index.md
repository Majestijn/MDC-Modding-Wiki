title: Welcome to the MDC Modding Wiki!
---

This is an open-source wiki managed by members of the Mod Dev Cafe (MDC) and was created by modders, for modders. You can join our [Discord server here](https://discord.gg/T5MGNBB)!

We don't like how there's many different tutorials all over the internet and each have different code styles and methods of creating mods - especially those ones which still use outdated methods! Therefore this wiki has been created with both those who create and consume tutorials in mind, providing a single place where many different tutorials can be found, and anyone can contribute to them.

## Viewing

If you are here to find tutorials, then welcome! I hope you find a tutorial suitable to your needs.

If not, then you can either contribute (see below) or create a suggestion of content in the [issues](https://github.com/Mod-DevCafeTeam/MDC-Modding-Wiki/issues).

Otherwise, you can find the [contents of this wiki here](https://mod-devcafeteam.github.io/MDC-Modding-Wiki/contents).

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this wiki, then you can create pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/Mod-DevCafeTeam/MDC-Modding-Wiki) for changes or additional content. However, there's a few rules you must abide by to keep this wiki well structured, clean and consistent:

* Please create tutorials in the most suitable categories. If a category does not exist, then you may create a new one and it will be reviewed in your pull request.
* Always add your new tutorial to the [contents page](https://github.com/Mod-DevCafeTeam/MDC-Modding-Wiki/blob/master/contents.md).
* When creating classes, please use the default code style and make code clean and readable.

Please try to also consider the following:

* Create example classes/resources where necessary. If you include any extra files with your tutorial, then you can group everything into a single directory.
* Tutorials' code examples should be written in Java first. Other language examples (e.g. Kotlin, Scala) can then be included.
